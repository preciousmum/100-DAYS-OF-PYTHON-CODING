# 100-DAYS-OF-PYTHON-CODING

## COLABORATING TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL
On July 4th 2023 i joined a group where i would be coding with other individuals on the 100-Days of Code course by Dr. Angela Yu on my path to become a software engineer, by October 12, 2023. I hope to have completed by 100 Days of coding and i would be documenting my Journey as i go

## DAY 1
This was an introduction to python coding, i learnt about 
- The syntax and the sematics, 
- The use of the print statement
- The input and variables

The project was a name generator for a pet

## DAY 2
On day 2 i was introduced to 
- Data types and how to check data types
- Mathematical operations

 I dida project titled TIP CALCULATOR

## DAY 3
On Day 3 I learnt about conditional statements. I use the for loops majorly to do fun and intresting things, i created a an intresting adventure project leading with the idea of dora the explorer. check it out here

## DAY 4
On Day 4 I learnt about Randomization and List in python.

## DAY 5
DAY 5 was a hetic one, i learnt about for loops in python and how to iterate through items using for loops.
