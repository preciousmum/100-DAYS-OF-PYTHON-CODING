# 100-DAYS-OF-PYTHON-CODING

## COLABORATING TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL
On July 4th 2023 i joined a group where i would be coding with other individuals on the 100-Days of Code course by Dr. Angela Yu on my path to become a software engineer, by October 12, 2023. I hope to have completed by 100 Days of coding and i would be documenting my Journey as i go

## DAY 1
This was an introduction to python coding, i learnt about 
- The syntax and the sematics, 
- The use of the print statement
- The input and variables

The project was a name generator for a pet

## DAY 2
On day 2 i was introduced to 
- Data types and how to check data types
- Mathematical operations

 I did project titled TIP CALCULATOR

## DAY 3
On Day 3 I learnt about conditional statements. I use the for loops majorly to do fun and intresting things, i created a an intresting adventure project leading with the idea of dora the explorer. check it out here

## DAY 4
On Day 4 I learnt about Randomization and List in python.
At the end of the day, i created the rock paper and scissors game.

## DAY 5
DAY 5 was a hetic one, i learnt about for loops in python and how to iterate through items using for loops. 

    #the for loop is used or declared using the for function
    for i in j:
        do this
    #where i is the item that will loop throug and J is the list or element to be looped through, 
    like i is the security guy checking each elements and j are the elements been checked.
    for loop is used for iterating over elements individually or in a range



At the end of the day, i made a password Generator project, which was fun and challenging to code<>

## Day 6
Day 6, I learnt about functions and how to create functions to optimize codes and break down long line of codes into block and mae code easily readable.
reeborgworld.org
I learnt the creation of functions and how to create functions using the def keyword
''' 
    
    def my_function():
        #Do this
        #Then do this
        #Also oo this
    '''
    Also lookig at looking at the while loop
    # Declaration of variable count or initial value
    while something_is_true:
        #Do this
    

While loop is used  when you want to carry out some funcionality until some condition is being fulfilled, i.e if the condition is not fulfilled it will keep on running and become an infinite loop

Functions are the basic building blocks of code, they are instructions that tells the computer what to do and helps in creating usable code 

>Tips: when you don't know why you are getting an infinite loop simply print out what is going on or the code.


## Day 7
>I finally did it!!!<br>
>I finally beat the hang man game and conquere my fears.
After 2-3 months of being afraid of this project and not attempting it for difficulty i finally won and even customized it to my own likening.

HANGMAN CONQUERED!!! HURRAY!!
